E-learning platforms can utilize real-time streaming of contextual content in accordance with the learning requirements of each learner based on their performance preferences and learning pace. As a learner goes through a course, he receives personalized content blocks that contain additional explanations, practice exercises or supplementary materials tailored to their individual needs, and also in accordance with their goals or tasks they want to achieve.

Adaptive learning is a mechanism of education that allows educational platforms to customize the learning experience to meet individual needs and preferences of each learner. E-learning platforms can utilize real-time streaming of content in view of the context of the user to continuously assess learner's progress, performance and preferences and accordingly deliver content by dynamically adjusting the learning path for each student. It offers personalized recommendations and interventions to optimize learning outcomes. The adaptive learning technology allows a variety of benefits such as the following:

**Continuous Assessment:** The platform systematically gathers data regarding learner’s engagements and quiz outcomes, allocation of time on each task and responses to instructional materials.

**Analysis and Profiling:** It involves sophisticated algorithms and data analysis that are constructed based on individualized profiles for each learner and keeps their proficiencies, deficiencies, learning inclinations and areas of improvement in consideration.

**Personalized Recommendations:** The technology allows to dynamically suggest specific micro content segments in accordance with user profiles and their current learning context as they progress through the curriculum. For example, if a learner faces difficulty with a particular concept, the adaptive learning technology that utilizes delivery of content blocks may receive supplementary elucidations and illustrative examples that target practice exercises related to that concept.

**Adaptive Interventions:** If a learner consistently faces certain challenges with certain subjects, the e-learning tool can modify the learning path by ensuring that proper remedial content, adaptive drills and alternate educational materials are available for users at the specific time they require it to effectively address their requirements.

This educational tool will continually monitor the advancements and performance of the learner and will adjust the educational journey as the user receives mastery in their specific areas or face new challenges.

Learners get real time feedback on their performance through micro content blocks and get comprehensive assistance to strengthen the areas that require improvement for achieving educational objectives.

**Personalization:** <a href="https://slejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40561-019-0089-y" target="_blank">Adaptive learning</a> paths enable personalized learning experience tailored to each learner's unique needs, preferences and learning path.

**Engagement:** Real time recommendations and interventions help a learner to actively be involved in their learning process and timely get assistance when they need it. This approach reduces frustration and provides sustained engagement.

**Efficiency:** Adaptive learning paths prioritize those areas that a learner requires the most support in, thereby improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the learning path. Hence, learners can achieve a superior outcome in less time.

**Retention:** Continuous assessment and adaptive interventions help long-term retention of knowledge and skills by addressing learner’s doubts and reinforcing important concepts that they need in real time.

Overall, adaptive learning paths, powered by a real time streaming of contextual content blocks, improve the effectiveness, efficiency and engagement of learning experience and ultimately help the learners achieve their learning objectives more effectively and at a faster pace.

## Formative Assessment and Feedback

Formative assessment is an integral part of the learning process which provides learners with feedback to improve their understanding and performance.

Teachers and instructors can use real time micro content blocks to provide formative feedback to students as they work on assignments or assessments. Students can receive immediate feedback in real time in the form of tips, hints or examples related to their current learning path and state.

Instead of waiting for a long time until the task is finished, this helps them learn and improve in the learning process in a better way. Educators can quickly provide learners with real time feedback using the micro content units. These units may contain advice, cues, clarifications, or corrections relevant to specific issues or doubts that a learner faces during the learning process.

Micro content blocks can be customized to address specific situations and mistakes or areas of improvement for the learner. Educators can see potential challenges and preemptively offer guidance to their learners whenever they face any obstacles or require an improvement in their performance.

Besides providing corrective feedback, micro content blocks of this adaptive learning technology can also provide affirmative reinforcement and support to their learners which help them recognize their advancements, dedication, and accomplishments. This feedback helps the learners motivate and improve their confidence levels, nurture their growth-oriented mindset and create a conducive learning environment.

Micro content blocks may include interactive elements such as quizzes, polls or reflection questions that are very powerful in engaging learners in their self-assessment. Learners can deepen their understanding by actively participating in the feedback process and identify their areas of improvement by taking ownership of their learning journey themselves through this interactive process.

Educators can customize the feedback process for accommodating learners' individual needs inclinations and learning modalities. For example, visual learners may find benefits in diagrams and illustrations whereas auditory learners may find audio explanations, podcasts, or verbal feedback more useful in their learning journey.

The continuous provision of formative assessment and feedback helps educators learn and assist their students in recognizing their competencies and deficiencies, monitoring their progress and affecting ongoing enhancements. This iterative feedback loop creates a deep learning and mastery of concepts which goes beyond surface level memorization or mechanical learning approaches that are generally otherwise available in traditional approach.

The real time instantaneous feedback process helps the learners to promptly correct any doubts and errors that they may have and reduces the risk of inaccuracies that are otherwise possible in traditional approaches of learning. This approach provides a more profound understanding and accelerates the overall learning process of individuals. Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement - John Hattie, <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/~mvp19/ETF/Feedback.pdf" target="_blank">The Power of Feedback</a>.

One of the powerful techniques of this technology is to segment the content into micro-learning blocks that permit customization to address the diverse needs and challenges of individual requirements. Research conducted by the International Journal of Computer Science and Engineering found that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373424876_The_Impact_of_AI-Driven_Personalization_on_Learners'_Performance" target="_blank">AI-driven personalized learning</a> experiences resulted in an improvement in learner performance. By addressing specific learning gaps through this precision learning technology, this tailored approach maximizes the efficacy of educational interventions for assisting in education programs.

Incorporating interactive feedback mechanisms through precision learning techniques and providing a positive reinforcement increases motivation among learners as reported by the 19th Australasian Computing Education Conference that highlights that the interactive precision learning methodologies increase learner participation by an average of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313013402_Interactive_Learning_Increasing_Student_Participation_through_Shorter_Exercise_Cycles" target="_blank">50%</a>.

Learners are deeply guided in the application of acquired knowledge and skills to new concepts which facilitates meaningful learning transfer and real-world application. University of Central Florida revealed that learners who received <a href="https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6055&context=etd" target="_blank">targeted feedback</a> such as through precision learning in the form of micro content blocks as discussed in this document exhibited a higher retention rate of knowledge compared to those without feedback guidance.
