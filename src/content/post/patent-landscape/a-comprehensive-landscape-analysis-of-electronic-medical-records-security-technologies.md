Initially, from 1999 to 2005, the patent activity in EMR security was minimal, with one or two filings per year, indicating either a nascent stage of technology or limited interest in securing electronic medical records. However, there is a notable increase starting in 2006, although the numbers remain low through 2008.

The period from 2009 to 2013 shows a gradual increase in patent filings, climbing from 13 to 79, which suggests a growing recognition of the importance of EMR security. The [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/fact-sheets/ehrs-advancing-americas-health-care.pdf) played a pivotal role in driving the increase in EMR security patents filing during that period. The ARRA, through provisions such as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, emphasized the importance of safeguarding patient information and mandated stricter security measures for EHR systems.

From 2014 onwards, there is a more pronounced upward trajectory. The year 2014 marked the crossing into significant counts with 108 filings, and by 2018, filings had increased to 160. This rise corresponds with the global push for digital health services and possibly reflects the [escalating threats to data security](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2014/12/21/the-top-u-s-healthcare-story-for-2014-cybersecurity/?sh=336079c64b76), prompting more innovation in protective measures.

The most significant growth occurred from 2019 to 2023, with the number of filings jumping from 192 to a peak of 238. This period, notably including the years affected by the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.aimspress.com/article/doi/10.3934/electreng.2021008?viewType=HTML), may have accelerated the digital transformation in healthcare, necessitating advancements in EMR security technology. The data reveals an increased emphasis on innovation in this field, likely driven by the growing complexity of cyber threats and the expansion of telemedicine.

The peak in 2023 with 238 filings suggests that EMR security technology is a critical and rapidly evolving area within healthcare technology. The increase in patents may reflect ongoing efforts to address new challenges in data protection and to keep pace with the evolving landscape of digital health.
